objective :-
 Gesture recognition helps computers to understand human body language. This helps to build
 a more potent link between humans and machines, rather than just the basic text user
 interfaces or graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
 In this project for (hand detection) gesture recognition, the human bodyâ€™s motions are read by
 computer camera. The computer then makes use of this data as input to handle applications. The
 objective of this project is to develop an interface which will capture human hand gesture
 dynamically and will control the volume level.
 After the hand detection in captured frames, the next step is to control the system volume
 depending on direction of hand movement.
 The hand movement direction is determined by generating and locating the bounding box on
 the detected hand
